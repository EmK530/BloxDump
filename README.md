  Welcome to the C# branch!<br>
  We're currently working on moving BloxDump over to C# so that we<br>
  can develop mesh dumping easier and generally provide more accessibility.<br>
  Do note that this code is not complete and whenever it is complete we will have merged it over to the main branch.
