A program that goes through Roblox's CDN cache and converts any recognized files.<br>
This essentially lets you dump assets from any Roblox game.

## How to use
* Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/EmK530/BloxDump/releases) page and download a version from there.<br>
If you want more details on BloxDump activity, download the debug zip file.<br>

* Make sure you extract the program into an empty folder, it will create extra folders for dumping.<br>
You also have to extract `PVRTexToolCLI.exe` because it is used for converting 3D textures.<br>

* After that just open `BloxDump.exe` and you should be good to go!<br>

BloxDump will dump anything downloaded from previous Roblox sessions or you can choose to clear your cache to prevent this.<br>
Any new cache files that pop up will be dumped so you can simply play a Roblox game and it will dump anything downloaded.
