## For Roblox game developers
Do you want your game to be blocked from use with BloxDump release builds?<br>
Contact EmK530 on Discord (emk530 / EmK530#0985) to request this.<br>
Make sure to provide evidence that you are the game's creator or a developer of it.

## Contributions
If there is any file format that you want to add support for, feel free to make a pull request!<br>
This is just a simple base for potentially a bigger dumping system.

## How to use
Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/EmK530/BloxDump/releases) page and download a version from there.<br>
Both x64 and x86 are provided for your type of system.<br>
Make sure you extract the program into an empty folder, it will create extra folders for dumping.<br>
After that just open BloxDump.exe and you should be good to go!
