A program that goes through Roblox's CDN cache and converts any recognized files.<br>
This essentially lets you dump assets from any Roblox game.

## How to use
* Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/EmK530/BloxDump/releases) page and download a version from there.<br>
* Make sure you extract the program and everything else somewhere safe, it will create extra folders for dumping.<br>
* After that just open `BloxDump.exe` and you should be good to go!<br>

When starting you will be prompted if you want to clear your cache.<br>
This is to prevent any old assets from being caught. Any new cache files that show up will be dumped in real-time.

## Support
List of everything BloxDump can currently dump:

    • 2D Textures (PNG / JFIF / WebP)
    • 3D Textures (KTX => PNG)
    • Fonts (TTF)
    • Meshes (v1-v7 => OBJ)
    • Sounds (OGG)
    • Videos (WEBM)
    • Translations (JSON)
    • RBXM Files

## Contributions
BloxDump is fairly complete and most file types are dumped now.<br>If there is something you want to improve feel free to make a pull request!
